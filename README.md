# MensLingua

MensLingua is a powerful Android app guiding the learning and perfecting of skills of either one's native language or a foreign language.  Unlike many apps for entry level learnings, MensLingua aims to bring one's skills to advanced levels effectively in a relatively short period of time.

"mens lingua" in latin means language of the mind.

## How it works

When getting started, you open/create a discipline, for instance English:French discipline for learning French from English.  You can import (at any time) various materials into a discipline: anki files, csv files, text, or even articles from the Internet.  Any material imported into a discipline will be intelligently put into the study plan with interrelations constructed.  MensLingua's study plan is defined by special algorithms that tracks your combined learning of words, phrases, and sentences so that efficiency and effectiveness are achieved.  Then you simply follow the plans MensLingua sets for you.  As you study, interrelations of the materials are further enriched.

The way to learn is mainly by going through various types of quizzes.  You can see your progress in charts and in journal.

## How is it different from apps like Anki

"Anki is a program which makes remembering things easy."

While MensLingua covers Anki's funtionality on languages (rather than all things), MensLingua focuses more on the full comprehension of an entire language, rather than only memorizing words.

## What are the colors?

Colors of words, phrases, and sentences represent levels of ease.  Dark green background color is for the best comfort of the eyes.

## How effective

I used the app to learn French for 1.5 years as I was developing it.  As people knowing me commented: "you knew very little French in the beginning, and now you can basically communicate with with us.  Bravo!".  That's very true, but what they don't know much is that my reading comprehension is alreaady in advanced levels.  I have now read about 10 French books, including (note these are not children's books nor easy books for foreigners):

* L'Étranger by Albert Camus, 150+ pages
* Mort d'une héroïne rouge by Xiaolong Qiu, 500~ pages
* Circé by Madeline Miller, 570+ pages
* La Vallée by Bernard Minier, 520+ pages
* La muse rouge by Véronique de Haas, 440+ pages
* Victime 2117 by Jussi Adler-Olsen, 600+ pages
